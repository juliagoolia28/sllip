## Getting Started
### Create environment for SLLIP analyses to occur
Everytime you work on SLLIP data analysis, you need to work within a designated environment:
-  Please copy and paste the content of https://github.com/Qlab-UDel/qlab/blob/master/analysis/mri-analysis/sample_bashrc into your own ~/.bashrc
-  Then type in command prompt:
```
source ~/.bashrc
sllip_env
```
