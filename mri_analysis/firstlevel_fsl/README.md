## SLLIP First-level Analysis

### Overview
The first level analysis for this study requires that you analyze each run seperately. Higher-level analyses will be utilized to combine across runs.
- In run 1, speech is always structured and tone is always random
- In run 2, tone is always structured and speech is always random. 
- These two runs are counterbalanced in order of presentation across participants to ensure there are no order effects driving conditional differences.

### FSL Designs
